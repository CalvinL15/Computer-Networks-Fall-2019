This is the second assignment of the course. It is an implementation of a simple Network Storage System with TCP Socket Programming.

Important notes:

Due to limitation in time, the codes are not written as cleanly as they should be. There might be some bugs for non-general cases, but overall the codes work properly and all commands are implemented.
